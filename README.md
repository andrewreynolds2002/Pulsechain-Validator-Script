# Pulsechain-Validator-Script
This is an example script for setting up a Validator on the Pulsechain network. 

It is still a work in progress, but for now this shows a working configuration using the Prysm Client for Consensus and Geth for the Execution Layer.

Included are also a link and command used to get the node Monitoring software up and running.
